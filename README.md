GoGeek is a lightweight, easy-to-use Go module designed to streamline interactions with the [BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) (XML API2).

## Key Features

- **üîÑ Simple Request Handling**: GoGeek abstracts the BGG API request process, allowing you to focus on utilising the data rather than managing HTTP requests.
- **üìÑ Data Parsing**: Automatically converts and normalises XML responses from the BGG API into Go structs, so you can work with structured data effortlessly.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling**: Robust error handling for common issues like network errors, rate limiting, queued requests and unexpected response formats.

## Setup

To setup GoGeek, use the following `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/kkjdaniel/gogeek
```

## Usage

Getting started with GoGeek is easy. Here‚Äôs a quick example to fetch details about specific board games:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/kkjdaniel/gogeek/thing"
)

func main() {
	games, err := thing.Query([]int{13, 12, 3})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for _, game := range games.Items {
		fmt.Printf("Name: %s\nYear Published: %d\n", game.Name[0].Value, game.YearPublished.Value)
	}
}
```

```
Name: CATAN
Year Published: 1995
Name: Ra
Year Published: 1999
Name: Samurai
Year Published: 1998
```

The `thing` query allows you to fetch details about a specific or multiple board games by BGG ID.

_Note: There is a query limit of 20 IDs per query due to restrictions of the BGG API. If you wish to fetch multiple games you will need to batch your requests._

## Documentation

For the full documentation please see the [GoDoc here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kkjdaniel/gogeek). Details on how to use each query function as well as the interfaces for each of the APIs can be found within their respective packages.
