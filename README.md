# GoGeek: Go Module for Simplified BoardGameGeek API Integration

GoGeek is a lightweight, easy-to-use Go module designed to streamline interactions with the [BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) (XML API2).

## Key Features

- **üîÑ Simple Request Handling**: GoGeek abstracts the BGG API request process, allowing you to focus on utilising the data rather than managing HTTP requests.
- **üìÑ Data Parsing**: Automatically converts XML responses from the BGG API into Go structs, so you can work with structured data effortlessly.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling**: Robust error handling for common issues like network errors, rate limiting, and unexpected response formats ensures smooth integration.

As of right now this module covers the public API, future work will aim to add coverage to the private API functions such as logging plays and modifying a user collection.

## Setup

To setup GoGeek, use the following `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/kkjdaniel/gogeek
```

## Usage

Getting started with GoGeek is easy. Here‚Äôs a quick example to fetch details about a specific board game:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/kkjdaniel/gogeek/thing"
)

func main() {
	// Catan
	game, err := thing.Query([]int{9})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	catan := game.Items[0]
	fmt.Printf("Name: %s\nYear Published: %d\nRating: %.2f\n", catan.Name[0].Value, catan.YearPublished.Value, catan.Statistics.AverageRating)
}
```
